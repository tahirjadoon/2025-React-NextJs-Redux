Add the script tag - manual way
	<script  src="assets/scripts/app.js" defer></script>
	defer means the script will be executed after the rest of the html document has been read ad parsed
	
or 
	<script  src="assets/scripts/app.js" type="module"></script>
	with module we can then import other js files 

Import/Export => must use type=module
	check util.js that exports a variable
	check app.js which is importing that variable
	
	When you run the idex.html, you'll get int cors issue 
		for this in cmd, navigate to the folder containing app.js 
		then type "node app.js"
		and you should see 
	
		app.js

	alternatively use Node.js

		The Node.js http-server module is an easiest way to host HTML files in any directory.

		Run the following commands to check if Node.js is already installed:
				node -v
				npm -v
				npx -v

		Let's assume the directory is /path/to/project. Run the following command to start the server:
		
		npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 9999
		or
		npx http-server C:\00Learning\Feature\001_JavaScript_Refresher -o -p 9999

		This hosts all files in the /path/to/project directory on localhost:9999. 
			type http://127.0.0.1:9999/ or https://localhost:9999
			The option -o will open the index.html page in a web browser. If index.html doesn't exist, then the directory is displayed instead.
